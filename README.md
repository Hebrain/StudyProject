This project aims to improve my knowledge regarding Asp Net Core, APIs, design patterns, clean code, clean architecture, SOLID, unit tests and 
other concepts and techniques that raise the level of the developer.

In this phase, a Data Drive API was developed, consisting of authentication, authorization with Roles, performance, compression, cache, versioning and 
documentation. The usability of JWT, ResponseCache, Use of contexts, good practices with Linq and the good use of asynchronism was very noticeable.
